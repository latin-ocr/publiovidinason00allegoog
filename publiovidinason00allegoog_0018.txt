With the primitive (fetichistic) notion os a separate lise in
every object, and tue human soul differing iu no essentia! regard
{rom the lile that dwells in things, it was easy to imagine the spirit
of man, beast, or plaut as passing from oue dwelling to another, ior
a longer or shorter stay. Such a transmigration was, iu lact,
taught as a creed by the school ol Pythagoras (see Metam. xv.
1-487). But, as against the Hindoo doctrine of transmigration
into the very lile oi other animals, the Greeks held to the identity
and continuity of the human soul, which after death had its abode
assigned in the Lower World. The metamorphosis, therefore,
is only an occasional miracle, not a real ourempsycleosis;† it did
not alter essentially the ordinary course of human lise, but only
marked the intimate connection between that and the lise of
externa] nature3 or, in a certain wild, pictorial way, showed the
workings of human fancy, to account sor the first creution ol plants
and animab, or other striking phenomena oi the natural world, -a

of peculiar shape (Atlas), a bird oi plaintive note (Philomela), or

To give something like system, order, and development to this
world of fable seems to have been a favorite aim of poetical com·
position with the ancients. This almis partly religious, and partly
scientifio-if that can be called scientihc which only fills with
fancies a void that no science yet exists to fill. Thus the “Theo-

of gods and heroes-making a sort ol pagan “ Genesis ’'-in a
form partly chronological, partly picturesque aud poetical. This

wusciousuess, deplores the change, and writes her own name on the saud, to inform her
father or it. This is metamorphosis, or change ol torm. According to the orientol
doctrine taught hy Pythagoras (Met. xv. 4 59), the heiter iu your stall was doubtless once a
