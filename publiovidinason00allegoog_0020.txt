, With the primitive (fetichistic) notion of a separate life in
every object, and tne human soul differing in no essential regard
from the life that dwells in things, it was easy to imagine the spirit
of man, beast, or plant as passing from one dwelling to another, for
a longer or shorter stay. Such a transmigration waS, in fact,
taught as a creed by the school of Pythagoras (see Metam. xv.
r—487). But, as against the Hindoo doctrine of transmigration
into the very life of other animab, the Greeks held to the identity
and continuity of the human soul, which after death had its abode
assigned in the Lower World. The metamorphosis, therefore,
is only an occasional miracle‚ not a real metempsychosis,·† it did
not alter essentially the ordinary course of human life, but only
marked the intimate connection between that and the life of
external nature3 or, in a certain wild, pictorial way, showed the
workings of human fancy, to account for the first creation of plants
and animab, or other striking phenomena of the natural world, -a
clear water-spring ina little island (Arethusa),a mountain ridge
of peculiar shape (Atlas), a bird of plaintive note (Philomela), or
a rock weeping with perpetual springs (Niobe).

'l'o give something like system, order, and development to this
world of fable seems to have been a favorite aim of poetical com-
position with the ancients. This aim is partly religious, and partly
scientific,-if that can be called scientific which only fills with
fancies a void that no seience yet exists to fill. Thus the “Theo
gony ’' of Hesiod groups together the myths relating to the birth
of gods and heroes-making a sort of pagan “Genesis ”-in a
form partly chronological, partly picturesque and poetical. This

Selection are given, mactaret, in the headings, thus presenting the entire argument
ot the Metamrphoses as a connected whole.

t Thus the princess lo is changed into a heifer (Met i. 611). She retains her human
consciousness, deplores the change, and writes her own name on the saud, to inform her
father of it. This is metamorphosis, or change of form. According to the oriental
doeoine taught by Pythagoras (Met. xv. 459), the heifer in your stall was doubtless onoe a
human being, perhaps your own mother or sister: it would be wicked to till her, and
impioua to eat her flesh. But she has only a brute consciousnese3 and simply thares the
uninnd fite of man and brute This is metempsychosis, or enam oi emh.
