2 Introduction to the

whose family history or personal adventures became the subject ,
of tales absolutely devoid of any symbolical meaning. In the .
system found in the Greek and Roman poets, nature is full of
mythological beingS‚ grouped— as subjects in a monarchy — about ·
theone celestial or royal family, which has its abode on Moun

Olympus. The King of Heaven, Zeus (Jupiter), with his sister·
queen Hnnn (June), is the child of Knorvos (Saturn) or Time,

who again is the son os OURANOS and GAIA (Heaven and Earth),

¹ beyond which imagination did not seek to go. His brothers are
POSEIDON (Neptune) and HABES (Pluto), kings of the Waters and
of the Lower World. His sisters are Deucrsn (Ceres) and Hssrm
(Vesta), queens of the Harvest and of the Home. llis sons are
Aronno, god of Light‚ Amas (Mars) of Strife, and Hennes
(Mercury) the Herald. His daughters are ΑΤΗΕΝΕ (Minerua),
APHRODITE (Venus), and ARTEM1s (Diana), goddesses of Wis-
dom, of Love, andos the Chase. These are the twelve great
divinities (dii majores). And about them, in nearer or remoter
kindred‚ are grouped the inferior deities, the heroes or demigodS‚
their children by half-mortal parentage, and the innumerable
progeny of sabulous beings inhabiting the kingdoms of sky,
water, or earth.

The other department of mythology is that with which this poem
chiefly deals. lt consists of the miracles and adventures ascribed
to these superhuman persons, - a vast field, in which ancient fancy
rioted as freely as the modern fancy in novels and fairytales.
Some of them may possibly be explained as a pictoresque way
of recounting natural phenomena, or as exaggerated tales of real
events. But in general they seem purely fictions of the imagina-
tion. In a very large proportion they take the form of inclamar-
pheses, that is, transformations os men or other creatores into
various shapes; and this feature gives the subject and the title of
the present poem (see the first lines of Book I.). lt professes
simply to tell those stories which have in them this element of the
marvellouS‚ —the transformations, particularly, of men into plants
or animals. But as nearly all myths introduce some such feature,
first or last, it manages to include nearly all the important ones
with more or less fulness. They are told in a rambling discursive
wag one story leading to another by the slightest possible l'mk
