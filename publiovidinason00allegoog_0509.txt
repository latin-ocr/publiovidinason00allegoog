The common date sor the intervening days may be found- if
Kalends, by adding two to the number ol' days in the month
preceding; sor Nones or Ides adding one to that of the day on t
which they fall, and then subtracting the given date:-thus, ¹

The sestertium (properly the gen. pl. of sestertius) was a
sum of money, not a coin; it is inflected regularly as a neuter
noun: thus, tria sestertla=Sr5ooo When combined with
anurneral adverb, dreerdreds are to be understood: thus decies
sestertium (decies HS)=ffiso‚ooo. In the statement of large

i sunm, the noun is osten omitted: thus, sexagies (Cic. Rosc.

s Am. 11.) signifies, sexagies [centena millia] sestertium = 3300900,
