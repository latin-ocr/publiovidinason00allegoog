Ante malr¹ et terlras Ι et Ι quod tegit Ι omnia Ι caelum, 5
Unus elrat tolto Ι nalturae Ι vultus in Ι orbe,

Quem dixlere Chalos: ΙΙ rudis Ι indilgestaque Ι moles,

N ec quiclquam nisi Ι pondus inlers, ΙΙ conigestaqu' elodem
Non bene Ι junctalrum ΙΙ dislcordia Ι semina l rerum.

Nullus adlhuc munldo ΙΙ praelbebat Ι lumina Ι Titan, 10
N ec nova Ι crescenldo Ι repalrabat Ι cornua Ι Phoebe,

Nec ciricumsulso ΙΙ penidebat in Ι aere Ι Tellus

Ponderilbus lilbrata solis, ΙΙ nec Ι brachia Ι longo

Margine Ι terralrum ΙΙ porlrexerat Ι Amphiltrite3

Quaque sulit tebius, ΙΙ illlic et Ι pontus et Ι aer.

Sic erat Ι instabillis telllus, ΙΙ inlnabilis Ι unda,

Lucis elgens aler; Ι nullli sua Ι forma mamebat,

Obstalbatqu' alijis alilud, ΙΙ quia Ι corpor' in Ι uno

Frigida Ι pugnalbant caliidiS‚ ΙΙ hulmentia Ι siccis,

Mollia Ι cum dulris,⁴ss sine Ι ponder' halbentia Ι pondus. 20
