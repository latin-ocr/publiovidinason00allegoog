tlon} 'Bacchus in Phrygia.

XVII. Tan Saone on ans.
[Boon XI.-85-193.]

Paoceemnu from Thrace into Phrygia, Bacchus is deserted by
Silenus, whom king Midas restores to him, and so receives from
Bacchus whatever boon he should desire. Choosing that whatever
be touched might become gold, Midas presently finds his gista
curse3 but by help of the god is freed from iton bathing in the
river Pactolus, whose sands thencefortb become gold (85-145).
Asterwards, frequenting woods and lonely places, he became
witness of a contest sor the palm of music between Pan and
Apollo, By Tmolus, the mountain-god, Apollo is judged victor;
and Midas pronouncing sor Pan, his ears are by Apollo lengthened
into ass's ears (146·179); the secretos which being by his servant
whispered to the earth, there sprang up reeds, which in their
rustling told the shame of Midas (180-193).

NEC satis hoc Baccho est: ipsos quoque deserit

agroS,

cumque choro meliore sui vineta Timoli
Pactolonque petit-quamvis non aureus illo
tempore, nec caris erut invidiosus arenis.
hunc assueta cohors satyri bacchaeque frequentant,
at Silenus abest. Titubantem annisque meroque 90
ruricolae cepere Phryges, vinctumque coronis
ad regem duxere Midan, cui Thracius Orpheus
orgia tradiderat cum Cecropio Eumolpo.
qui simul agnovit socium comitemque sacrorum,
hospitis adventu· festum genialiter egit 95
perbis quinque dies et junctas ordine noctes.

Et jam stellarum sublime coegerat agmen
Lucifer undecimus, Lydos cum laetus in agros
rex venit, et juveni Silenum reddit alumno.
huic deus optandi gratum, sed inutile, lecit ω
muneris arbitrium, gaudens altore recepto.
