[Boon IX.-134—272.]

[Aenaaous continuing the discourse‚te11s of the transforma-
tions of Proteus; and of Metra, daughter of Eresichthon, who
(receiving this power from Neptune) long, by cheats and wiles,
sustained her father cursed with extreme rage of hunger for the
violation osa grove of Ceres (V111. 725-884). And as Theseus
inquires the cause ol his broken horn, Achelous replies that con-
tending once with Hercules for the possession of Dejanira, sister
os Meleager, that horn had been wrested off, and, being filled by
the Naiads with autumn fruits, became the horn of Plenty (IX.
1-100). In defence of the same Dejanira, Hercules had once
slain the centaur Nessus ; who, dying, gave her a tunic stained
with his blood, mixed with venom of the Lernaean hydra, which (he
said) would recall her husband’s love if ever it should wander or
cool (ror-133).]

Afterward, Hercules being about to wed Iole, daughter oi Eury-
tus, DejanIra sent to him this tunic as a marriage gift But when
it took heat from the altar flames as he was about to sacrifice, Her·
cules, being in extreme torment‚ and unable to tear it off, cast into ·
the sea the bearer of the gift, LichaS, who was converted into a
rock, retaining his human form (134-227). , Then Hercules, build-
ing a¹ great firneral pile upon Mount OEta of Thessaly, burned him-
self thereon; and, his mortal parts being purged away, was⁴
received into the company of the gods (228-272).
