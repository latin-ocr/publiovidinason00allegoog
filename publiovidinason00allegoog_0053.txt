. [OF the family of Cadmus, Actaeon, having beheld Diana as
she was bathing with her nymphS, was changed by her into a stag,
and torn in pieces by his own hounds (lll. 138-252). Semele
became the mother of BacchuS, but was destroyed by the presence
of Jupiter, whom she desired to see clothed with flames and thunder
(253-315)· TiresiaS, the Theban seer, is made blind, but endowed
with prophecyl316-338). The nymph Echo, pining with love of
NarcissuS, becomes a rock, her voice alone surviving (339-401);
while Narcissus, garing on his image ln a fountain, perishes, and
by the water-nymphs is converted to a flower (402-510). Pen-
theus, having denied the god Bacchus, and forbidden his solem·
nitieS, and caused him to be seized, is torn in pieces by Bacchanals,
his mother and sisters aiding: Bacchus meanwhile (in the form of
Acaetes) relates the miracle wrought by himself upon a Tyrrhenian
crew, whose ship's tackle he had converted to serpents‚ and them·
selves to dolphins (511-733). Three Theban sisters (Minyeides)
likewise refrain from the rites of Bacchus: of whom one relates the
tale of Pyramus and Thisbe (IV. 1-54)].

These young lovers, dwelling in Babylon, had appointed a
meeting at the tomb of king Ninus (55-92). Thisbe, coming
first, is terrified by a lion and so escapes. Pyramus, soon arriving,
finds tracks of the beast and the torn mantle of Thisbe ; and con·
ceiving that she is slain, stubs himself with his sword, his blood
reddening the fruit of the mulberry, at whose foot he lies (93-12'7).
Thisbe, soon returning, finds him dying, and slays herself with the
sword yet warin (128-166).

YRAMUS et Thisbe, juvenum pulcherrimus aller,
alteru, quas Oriens habuit, praelata puelliS,
contiguas tenuere domne, ubi dicitur altam
coctilibus muris cinxisse Semiramis urbem.
