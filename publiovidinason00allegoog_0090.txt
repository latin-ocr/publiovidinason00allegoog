[Ducurvrwe the daughters of Pelias, Jasou’s enemy, by a
similar miracle wrought upon an aged ram, Medea brings about
their iather’s death (Vll. 297-349). Escaping by means oi winged
dragous, and passing over the scene os many transformatione,
Medea comes to Athens3 whence (ber attempted poisoning oi
Theseus being foiled by the recognition oi his father AEgeus) she
suddenly vanishes (350-424). A least is celebrated in honoros
Theseus' exploits ; and hostility ensuing with Minos (Europa's son)
os Crete, Cephalus is seut as envoy to AEgina; to whom the aged
AEacus relates the marvellous transformation of ants to men (called
Myrmidons)‚ after his realm had been ravaged by pestilence (425-
660). Now Cephalus had received from his wife Procris a honnd
aud a dart that never missed its aim; and, as he delighted greatly
in hunting, Procris being jealous watched him srom a thicket; and
he, taking it ior the movement of some wild creature, shot her with
that dart which was her own gift (661-865). Minos, making war
on Atheus to aveuge the slaying oi bis son Androgeos, comes first
to Megara, where Scylla, daughter os the king Nisus. out of love
lor Minos cuts the purple lock on which her father’s kingdom and
ute depend. Disdained by Minos, she is changed to a sea-mew,
and Nisus to an osprey (Vlll. 1-1 51).]

Theseus, in his escape from the Cretan labyrinth‚ had borne
away Ariadne, daughter oi Minos; who, sorsaken by him, is com-
forted by Bacchus, who sets her coronet among the stars (152-182).
Daedalus, builder of the labyrinth‚ being imprisoued, escapes with
his son lcarus by means oi wings sasteued with wax; but Icarus,
soaring too near the sun, and the wax melting, falls into the sea
named sor him (183-234). His fallis gladly seen by Perdix, once
sister’s sou to Daedalus, and slain by him out os envy, but changed
by Minerva to a partridge (ης-259).
