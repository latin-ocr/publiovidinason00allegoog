vi The Life ff Ovt‘d.

the emperor at some weakness, lolly‚ or fault, which he says
he is ‘not free to tell. Some have thought he was indiscreet
enough to make love to Julia, the brilliant, witty, and erratic
daughter oi the emperor, wife of the grave Agrippa, others
that he unfortunately knew too much ol some court scandal,
probably connected with Julia or her ill-lamed and ill-lated ,
daughter, others that AugustuS, as public patron oi morals,
took offence at the soniewhat cynical indecorum oi certain
ot his poems. At any rate, the emperor was hardened
against all his flatteries and prayers, aud aiter an exile oi
about ten years he died at Tomi, A. n. 18.

Besides the poems represented in this volume, Ovid was
the author of the Ars Amatoria and the Remedium Amoris
(to which reference has just been made), and oi numerous
“Elegies,” including tour books oi letters written in exile
(Ex Ponto Libri iv.). As a poet, his lame is tar below that
of Virgil and Horace, - deservedly‚ since his loose and easy
verse bears no comparison with the elaborate finish oi theirs.
For fancy and fine poetic feeling, however, many of the
Elegies - both in the Tristia and the Amores- show a vein
of as good quality as either oi his rivals; while in absolute,
ease oi handling the artificial structure οἳ Latin verse it may
be doubted whether he has ever had an equal. His chief
merit, however, is as an excellent story-teller,—smooth,
facile, fluent, sometimes, it must be contessed, inordinately
diffuse. As the most celebrated existing collection oi the
most famous iables oi the ancient world, the Metmomhoses,
in particular, makes the best oi introductions to the nobler
and more difficult verse oi Virgil.
