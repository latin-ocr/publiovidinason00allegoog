IV· ro] Tae Poet’s Antobrography. 271

68. fabulascandal.

78. lustris : as the lustrum is generally reckoned at five years,
this would make his father ninety at the time of his death (but see
’ below, note to v. 95).

80. justa, due (funeral) vites.

88. in Stygio foro, in tlte court of Pluto.

95. ortus, birth. -Pisaea oliva: the reward to the victor in
the Olympic games (held in the territory of Pisa) was a crown ol
wild olive. As these games came once in four years, decies victor
would naturally mean sorty years; he was, however, filty at the time
of his banishment‚ and we can account sor the discrepancy only by
supposing that he reckoned the Olympiad at five years, an almost
inconceivable blunder. Mommsen explains it, however (Ro'm.
Chron. p. 170), hy calling attention to the confusion os the ancients
themselves in regard to the expression quinto quoque anna for the
period in the Julian calendar: “the poet‚’' he says, “rightly sup·
posed that the Olympiad and the Julian lustro [decem lustris perac-
tis, Ibis. 1]‚ were of equal length, and very wrongly supposed the
latter to be five years.’'

97. ad laeva, i.e. as one sails out from the Propontis (Mar-
mora). ,
