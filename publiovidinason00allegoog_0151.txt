[AEunns had passed, on the coast of Italy, the isle of the Cer-
copes, turned by Jupiter into apes (XIV. 75-1oo)‚ and coming to
Cumae, finds the Sibyl Amalthea, daughter of Scylla, who relates
that, being loved by Apollo, he had granted her wish to live so
many years as the grains of sand in her hand (ror-153). Arriving
at Cajetas, he meets Macareus, an old companion of Ulysses, who
relates the adventure of the Cyclops and the enchantments of
Circe, at whose palace they had remained a full year (154-312).
During this time, Circe tells of Picus, son of Saturn, whom, not
returning her love, she had converted to a woodpecker‚ and his
companions to various beasts, while his wife Canens wasted into
air (313-440). ln the wars which followed AEneas’ arrival in
Latium, Diomed refuses aid to Turnus, but his companions, desir-
ing to grant it, are changed to white hinds (441-511). Various
transformations follow: of the sheplierd Apulus to a wild olive3
of AEneas’ ships to water-nymphs 3 of the ashes of the city Ardea
to a heron; and at length of AEneas himself to one of the gods
Indigetem· of Tiberinus to a river; of Vertumnus to sundry shapeS‚

ι with the tales by which he at length won the love of Pomona;
lastly of Romulus who at his death became the god Quirinus, and
his wife Hersilia the goddess Ora (512-85 ).]

Guided by an ancient sage, Numa seeks wisdom among the
Greeks of Southern Italy3 [whereby violating the Sabine laW, he
is accused, but acquitted, the black lots being changed by miracle
to white in the um (XV. 1-59)]. At Croton Pythagoras, exiled
from Samos instructs him in the doctrine of metempsychosis
and the law which forbids all shedding of blood. This was
unknown in the golden age, but began with the slaughter ol
animals for food (75-142). Pythagoras - recalling his own former
existence as Euphorbas (slain by Menelaus before Troy)-teaches
that all life incessantly passes from one to another form ; all things
are in flux and change -the heavenly bodies, the seasons types of
human life, the elements with their transmutations‚ the vast changes
on the face of the earth (237-277). [These changes detailed:
waters that clisappear‚ or overflow regions once dry ·, islands lumel&

from mainland, and plains uplifted into hills3 springs alternately
