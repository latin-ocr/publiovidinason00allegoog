The tale of Perseus (like that of Hercules and many other
heroes) represents the daily course of the sun, in conflict with the
powers of darkness and storm. The harpe is his gleaming ray;
the Graiae are the twilight; the Gorgons are the stormeloud,
which rests upon the bosom of the sea-vave, and is cloven by the
‘⁶ golden sword ’' of the lightning. The jagged edges of the cloud,
and the crimson stream which pours srom it in the glow of sunset,
help out the features os the image.
