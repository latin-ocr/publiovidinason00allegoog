186 Notos: Ouril. [insutu

all cases where there are words of more than two syllables; lor
thus a short syllable will osten serve as a lrey to the entire structure
of the verse.

For examples, we will take the first four lines of the poem.

1. In noaofert animus rnutdlos dlcere formos.

Here the last three words are scanned exactly as they read:
mutatas Ι dicere Ι formas. Of the others, dnirnus shows by its
accent that thei of the penult is short; and, as its last syllable
rnust belong to the following foot, nothing more is needed to show
⁴ that the verse will scan as follows : —
111 nhva Ι fert iinllmus ΙΙ multatas Ι dicere Ι formas3

and the quantity of the other syllables is shown at once by their
Ι position in the verse.

2. Corpora: Di, creptis —nam vos mutastis et illos-

The first word corporo, being a dactyl, at once gives a correct start to

the verse. The second foot‚ Di coep--is equally plain, as a spondee3

and after this beginning, the rest of the verse scans of itself τ -
Corpora: Ι Ι)ἱ, οοερῖτίε ΙΙ —narn Ι vos multastls et Ι illas.

3. Adspirate meis,· prioraque ab origine mundi.

The first word, adspirate, is nearly as clear, as, when we rememher
either the pronunciatien of odsplro or the quantity of the o of the
first conjugation, we see that it contains three long syllables, a
spondee and the beginning of a dactyl. The last three feet are
pronounced exactly as in prose (obscrving the elision) z -
Adspi³ratd melis3 ΙΙ priimaqu' ab hlriglne Ι mundi.

4. Ad mm perpetuum deducite temporo carmen.

Here the three last words form a perfect metrical series; and the
only difficulty in the verse is caused by the ictus coming on the
first syllable of perpetuum, while the accent is on the second.

Ad inea Ι perpettilum ΙΙ ἀεΙάῡςῐῖέ Ι temphrd Ι carmen.

These directions would be sufficient for all or nearly all cases*
if it were not for the frequent elision of the last syllable of words:
viz., in general, whenewer o word ending in a vowel or in m is
followedby a word beginning eoin o vowel or with h. This
makes the commonest and most annoying of the obstacles to he
met, and requires the beginner to be constantly on the watch. lf
he will now carefully compare the following lines. as metrically
divided, with the rules which have been given above, it is hoped
that he will have little difficulty hereafter.

¹ lt will be observed that, of the first twenty versos ot' the poem, only the 8th and 13th
laclr the caesura in the third foot; while in the roth, reth, and roth the ufineiod natue is
io tna fourth foot instead of the third
