nithe productive power of the soil, who seeks her child Proser·
pina (Persephone, called also Κορῆ, the maiden), stolen from her
sight by the king of the lower world, and only restored to her by
Jupiter for six months of each year. By this parable the ancients
understood the annual sowing of the grain-harvest, by which the
corn is hidden in the ground through the winter months, but re·
stored in spring to sunlight, and ripening to the harvest, in which
the yearly festival of Ceres is celebrated with religious rites.
