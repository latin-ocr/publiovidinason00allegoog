100 The Song os Orpheus. [Murus¹

cura dolorque animi lacrimaeque alimenta fuere. 75
esse deos Erebi crudeles questus, in altam

se recipit Rhodopen pulsumque aquilonibus Haemum.

XV. Tus Sowo or Onehnus.

[Boou X.—86-219.]

WITHuRan apart from the love of women, and having
gathered by his song a grove of forest trees [among them the pine
which was once the youth Attis, and Cyparissus changed by Apollo
into a Cypress], Orpheus sings of the loves of the gods for mortal
men. And first of Ganymede of Troy, borne to heaven by Jupiter
in the form of an eagle ¹(143-161); and of Hyacinthus, a beautiful
youth of Sparta, beloved by Apollo but accidentally killed by him
with a discus (or quoit) that he had hurled into the air ; from
whose blood sprang the flower that bears his name (162-219);

[He further sings of certain people of Cyprus, cruel to
strangers, who by Venus were changed to oxen (azo-237); of the
statue wrought by Pygmalion, which became a living maiden, and
his bride (243-297) ; of Myrrha, who because of ber incestuous love
of her father became a tree weeping fragrant gum (298-502) ; of her
child Adonis, loved by Venus (503-559) ; of Atalanta, fleet of foot,
who was won in the race by craft of Hippomenes with three golden
apples but both were afterwards changed into lions (560-707);
and of the death of Adonis, slain by a wild boar, and by Venus
converted into the flower Anemone, as Menthe had aforetime been

by Proserpine into the herb Mint (708-739)·]

COLLIS erat, collemque super planissima campi
area, quam viridem faciebant graminis herbae. Ι
umbra loco deerat: qua postquam parte resedit
dis genitus vates, et fila sonantia movit,
umbra loco venit. Non Chaonis afuitarbor‚ 90
