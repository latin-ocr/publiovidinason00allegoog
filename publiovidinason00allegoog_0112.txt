Χ. 7.] Ι· Orpheus and Eurydice.

XIV. Onennus nur> Eunvorcu.
[Boou X.-r-77.]

[Ancum mother of Hercules, to entertain lole (who had
married his son Hyllus), relates the tale of Hercules’ birth, which
was long delayed, but at last brought about by the artifice of Galan-
this, a waiting maid; who, for the falsehood she told, was turned
into aweasel by ilithyia, whom she had deceived (lX. 273-323).
Ioie relatos in turn of her sister Dryope, changed to a lotus
(324—339). The restoring of Iolaus to youth, and the miraculous
manhood bestowed on the children of Callirhoe, having moved the
displeasure of some of the gods, Jupiter reminds them of the pain-
ful oid age of his own son Minos (400-442). The tale is told of
Byblis, daughter of Miletus (who had migrated from Crete to Asia):
she, filled with a guilty love for her brother Cannus, became a foun-
tain in Caria (443-665). lphis, daughter of Ligdus of Crete, having
been brought up as a youth to avoid her father's displeasure that a

. daughter was born to him, was at length changed to a young man

by lsis, and so became the husband ol Ianthe (666—797).]

Hymen, proceeding to Thrace, aster the marriage of lphis,
unites Orpheus to Eurydice, but not happily, for she died from the
bite ol a serpent. To recover her, Orpheus penetrated the shadows
of the lower World, where even the Furies are moved to tears at
his song, the pains of hell are stayed, and Proserpine is won to
yield him back his wife, only on condition that he shall not look
behind him till again in the upper world. Turning about too soon,
in his eagerness to see her, he loses her again, and is not suffered
a second time to enter Hades (X. 1-77).
