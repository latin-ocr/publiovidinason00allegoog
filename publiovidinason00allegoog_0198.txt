NOTES.

In is supposed that most classes who read Ovid at all, will read
Ovid before any other Latin poet; and as it is desirable that a
poetical composition should always be read as verse, -that is, with
a knowledge of its rhythmical structure. - a few directions will
here be given for soanning at sight, or by ear3 which, with a little
practice, will be found an easy, almost meclranical process.

Itis necessary, first, for the learner to understand the nature
of the verse, as depending on precisely the same principles as the
rhythmical divisions of music (See Gr. p. 263); als0, to be familiar
with the general rules of Quantity and Accent (§§18, 19).* Besides
this, the teacher should explain and illustrate, so far as may be
necessary, the structure of the hexameter (ξ 362), reading from
the text of the poem itself, until its peculiar movement has become
familiar to the learner’s ear. lt will now be observed-

1. That the difficulties in scanning lie almost entirely in tlte
first lzalf of tlte verse. With very rare exceptions, the last two
feet, and generally the last three, are accented in verse exactly as
they would be in prose: that is, the thesis (first syllable) of the
foot corresponds with the natural or prose accent of the word.

2. That in hexameter verse tlte tlrird soor (rarely the fourth
instead) regularly begins with the last syllable of a word. Thus,
while the last half of a verse is almost always accented as in prose,
the first half very seldom is. The slight pause interrupring rhu
foot at the end of the word is called a coesural pause (ξ 3 58. b);
andis the most important point that distinguishes the movement
of verse from that os prose. The pause in the third foot (less
commonly the fourth) usually corresponds with a pause in the
sense, and is called the principal caesura.

3: That whenever a short syllable occurs in the verse, llere
must be a dactyl. This becomes a most convenient rule, as soon
as the pronunciation of even the communest words is linown, in

’To these it may be well to add the quantity of final syllables ih 348). The
