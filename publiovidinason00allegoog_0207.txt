191. ne . . . trahatur, lest tlte round (lit. clean) part be drawn
[into the same disease].

193. faunique: the enclitic ·que is here made long in imitation
of Homer, who makes the Greek τε long. lt is probably made so
by the pause at the end of the word, or, as it is sometimes called,
by casura. This occurs generally in the second soot oi the verse,
and only when a second ·que follows. The Fauni and Silvani-
Italian nature divinities -are here joined with the Greek Satyrs.
These were fabulous creatures, types os the wikl lise of the forest.
They are represented with horns, goats’ legs and ieet, and pointed
hairy ears. The Greek name is an old word sor goat.

Augustus's empire are spoken of as his kindred or friends.-
