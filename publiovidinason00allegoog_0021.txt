4 Introduction.

is apparently the first attempt of human thought to deal systemati·
cally with the phenomena of nature-so as, in a manner, to
account for things-before rnen were sufficiendy free from super·
stition to reject the early sables. The titles of several Greek works
os the same kind are known; and Virgil, in the Sixth Eclogue,
puts a similar song into the mouth of Silenus

Any thing like a real belief in these fables had passed away long
before the time of Ovid. He was the popular poet of a sensual
and artificia! age, who found in these creations of ancient fancy
a group of subjects suited to his graceful, ornate, and marvellously
facile style ol narrative, and who did not hesitate to alteror dress
them up to suit his purpose. The “ Metamorphoses ” -Librz' xv. ⁴
Metamorphoseon (a Greek genitive)-is the most abundant and
rich collection of these sables that exists. They are told in a
diffuse, sentimental, osten debased way, which contrasts strongly
with the serious meaning that originally belonged to these myths;
but are wonderfully fluent, easy, and melodious in their language, and
show a skill of versification which seems never to halt or weary.
The poem begins with the first origin of things from chaos, the
four ages of gold, silver, brass‚ and iron, the deluge‚ followedby the
graceful and pictoresque version os the tales of gods and heroes,
through a long narrative-about 12‚ooo verses in all-ending
with the apotheosis oi Caesar, as the sequel of the tale oi Troy.
The series purports to be chronological3 but the order is often
arbitrary and the connection forced or affected, as would naturally
be the case with an author res diversissimas inspeciem unius
corporis collegentem (Quint iv. 1, 77).

The mythology of Ovid and the other Roman poets was Greek
mythology dressed up in Roman names. lt is not necessary to
remind the reader that the storics here told related to Zeus,
Athene, Artemis, and the other members of the Greek Olympus,
and could never have been attributed to the sober abstractions oi
the Roman Pantheon. Nevertheless‚ in commenting upon Ovid,
it is impossible to avoid making use of the names in the same
sense that he did-the names long familiar in modern litera·
ἵ ture, which took them from the Romans and not the Greeks.
