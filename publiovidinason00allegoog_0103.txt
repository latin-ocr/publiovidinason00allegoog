Philemon and Baucis. [Meam.

XII. Puruemou awo Baucis.

[Boorc Vlll.-622-724]

[Hancucca returning from the Calydonian Hunt, is entertained
with his friends by the river-god Achelous, who recounts the fate of
certain nymphs, turned into rocks and islands. These prodigies
are mocked by Pirithous, son of Ixion, who is among them. To
silence his cavil, Lelex relates the following tale (589-619).]

’ Jupiter and Mercury, journeying once in Phrygia, were refused
hospitality by all the inhabitants of a certain place, except two
pious rustics, Philemon and his wife Baucis, who provide such
entertainment as they are able (ono—688). While the inhospitable
town was drowned in a marsh, the poor hut of Philemon became
a temple, of which he and his wife were made attendants ; until in
a good old age they were botb transformed to trees, be toan oak
and she to a linden (689·724).

ILlAE contermina quercus
collibus est Phrygiis, modico circumdata muro.

haud procul huic stagnum est, tellus habitabilis olim, ’
nunc celebres mergis fulicisque palustribus undae. 625
Juppiter huc specie mortali, cumque parente

venit AtlantiadeS, positis caducifer alis.

mille domos adiere, locum requiemque petentes:

mille domos clausere serae. Tamen una recepit,
parva quidem, stipulis et canna tecta palustri: ⁶30
sed pia Baucis anus parilique aetate Philemon

illa sunt annis juncti juvenilibus, illa

consenuere casa3 paupertatemque fatendo

effecere levem, nec iniqua mente ferendo.

decrescit, dominos illic, famulosne requiras: 635
tota domus duo sunt, idem parentque jubentque.

Ergo ubi caelicolae parvos tetigere penateS,

summissoque humiles intrarunt vertice postes,
membra senex posito jussit relevare sedili,
